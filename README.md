IS445 -Data Visualization

Final Project

My biggest takeaway from this class has been approaching visualizations I see in day-to-day life with a critical lense. I notice the use of tactics that distort data, such as showing three-dimensional graphs or not starting an axis scale at zero. The weekly visualization reports really helped with devloping this skill. My other takeaway was learning more about how to create visualizations in Jupyter Notebooks using matplotlib and bqplot.

I would have liked to have had a full unit on either Tableau or PowerBI. I appreciated the video you made about PowerBI, but it would have been great to dive into these tools more, since they're so common in the industry but take a fair bit of work to learn.

Thank you for this class!
